# Folder Structure 

I have read some articles related to folder structures in VueJS but this one is the best so far when it comes to long term project or project complexity.
[Check out the setup docs](https://simeonnortey.medium.com/how-to-structure-folders-in-your-vue-application-ea3934d56380)

# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about IDE Support for Vue in the [Vue Docs Scaling up Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html#ide-support).

# Learnings

 This practice will help me understand how VueJS work when it comes to dom manipulation, reusability of the components, bindings, api integration or service integration,  and lifecycle hooks. I have used Composition API (Vue 3) in this project.
